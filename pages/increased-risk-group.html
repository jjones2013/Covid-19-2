            <!-- <hr class="my-4" /> -->
            <h4 id="intro" >According to the Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC), "among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die." So a fair question is: Why does the risk for severe illness increase with age? Let's consider some interesting findings.&ast; </h4>

            <h3>Older Adults</h3>
            <P> As you get older, your risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases.<img src="../../Covid-19-2/images/older_adult.jpg" alt="Older man with mask on" class="responsive my-2">
              For example, people in their 50s are at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 40s. Similarly, people in their 60s or 70s are, in general, at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 50s. The greatest risk for severe illness from COVID-19 is among those aged 85 or older.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Underlying Medical Conditions</h3>
            <p> There are also other factors that can increase your risk for severe illness, such as having underlying medical conditions. By understanding the factors that put you at an increased risk, you can make decisions about what kind of precautions to take in your daily life.

              <p>It is especially important for people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, and those who live with them, to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.</p> 
              <p>The best way to protect yourself and to help reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is to:</p>
                <ul style="list-style: square;" >
                  <li>Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible.</li><br>
                  <li>Take <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html" target="_blank">precautions to prevent getting</a>  COVID-19 when you do interact with others.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you start feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19, get in touch with your      healthcare provider within 24 hours.
                </p>
              
              <img src="../../Covid-19-2/images/who_at_risk.jpg" class="responsive" alt="Man and woman wearing masks">
              <br><br>
               <p>In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.</p>

              <ul>
                <li style="list-style: square;">If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.
                </li><br>
                
                <li style="list-style: square;">Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.
                </li><br>
               
                <li style="list-style: square;">If possible, avoid others who are not wearing cloth face coverings or ask others around you to wear cloth face coverings.</li>
